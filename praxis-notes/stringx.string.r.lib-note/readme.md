Due to the proliferation of the internet, smartphones, social media, and other technologies and communication platforms, this is no longer the case. This package replaces base R string functions (such as grep(), tolower(), sprintf(), and strptime()) with ones that fully support the Unicode standards related to natural language and date-time processing. It also fixes some long-standing inconsistencies, and introduces some new, useful features. Thanks to 'ICU' (International Components for Unicode) and 'stringi', they are fast, reliable, and portable across different platforms."
