Even in cases with simple rules, rich and complex behavior is found to emerge, and striking correspondences to some important core known features of fundamental physics are seen, suggesting the possibility that the models may provide a new approach to finding a fundamental theory of physics. // 介绍了一类旨在尽可能简化和无结构的模型。即使在规则简单的情况下，也发现出现了丰富而复杂的行为，并且观察到与某些重要的已知基本物理核心特征的显著对应关系，这表明这些模型可能为寻找物理学基本理论提供了一种新方法。"
