It is a minimalist language that supports multiple dispatch from Julia and ownership dogma from Rust, while also incorporating the simplicity and ease of use of Julia. Just is a compiled language that is designed to be portable and embeddable, making it possible to develop Just programs that can run on a wide range of platforms, including embedded systems. With its strict ownership model and static typing, Just provides improved performance and reliability, making it well-suited for scientific and numerical computing as well as other applications. // Just 是一种结合了 Julia 和 Rust 最佳功能的编程语言。它是一种极简主义语言，支持 Julia 的多重调度和 Rust 的所有权教条，同时还融合了 Julia 的简单性和易用性。 Just 是一种编译语言，设计为可移植和可嵌入的，使得开发可以在包括嵌入式系统在内的各种平台上运行的 Just 程序成为可能。凭借其严格的所有权模型和静态类型，Just 提供了改进的性能和可靠性，使其非常适合科学和数值计算以及其他应用程序。"
