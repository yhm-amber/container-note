[site]: https://gpui.rs/ "A fast, productive UI framework for Rust from the creators of Zed. // Today, it's Zed's UI framework. Tomorrow, it's yours! We'd love your help making that happen. // GPUI is an open source project. We welcome contributions, but for the near future GPUI is tied to Zed, so contributions will need to be made there and kept in sync with it. /// GPUI 是一个开源项目。我们欢迎贡献，但在不久的将来， GPUI 要与 Zed 绑定，因此需要在那里做出贡献并与之保持同步。"
[crates]: https://crates.io/crates/gpui "Hi! If you're someone from Zed and want to publish your `gpui` library, please contact me. I will give you the ownership of this crate for free. I am just trying to protect your library's name, as you guys seem to have forgotten to. // 你好！如果您是来自 Zed 的人并想发布您的 gpui 库，请与我联系。我会免费给你这个板条箱的所有权。我只是想保护你们图书馆的名字，因为你们似乎忘记来注册它了。"
