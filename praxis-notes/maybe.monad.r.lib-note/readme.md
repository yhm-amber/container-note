It is often used instead of throwing an error or returning 'NULL'. The advantage of using a maybe type over 'NULL' is that it is both composable and requires the developer to explicitly acknowledge the potential absence of a value, helping to avoid the existence of unexpected behaviour. // 也许：也许单子 /// Maybe 类型表示有某个值或没有值的可能性。它经常被用来代替抛出错误或返回“NULL”。使用 Maybe 类型相对于 'NULL' 的优点是它都是可组合的，并要求开发者明确承认可能的缺席，有助于避免出现意外行为。"
