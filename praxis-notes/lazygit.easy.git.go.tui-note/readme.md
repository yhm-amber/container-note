Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? Are you kidding me? To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any further but contains code you don't want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file by hand? Are you KIDDING me?! Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren't even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! b/ 牢骚时间：你以前肯定听过，git 很强大，但当一切操作都如此困难时，这种力量又有什么用呢？交互式变基要求你在编辑器中编辑一个该死的 TODO 文件？你在开玩笑吗？为了暂存文件的一部分，你需要使用命令行程序逐块进行操作，如果一块无法再分割但包含你不想暂存的代码，你必须手动编辑一个神秘的补丁文件？你在开玩笑吗？！有时在切换分支时会被要求暂存你的更改，结果发现切换后甚至没有冲突，直接检出分支不就好了？你肯定是在开玩笑吧！ /// If you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you. // 如果你像我一样是个普通人，并且厌倦了每天听到 git 多么强大，但在日常生活中它却是个让你头疼的强大东西，那么 lazygit 可能适合你。"
