It has the ability to undergo photosynthesis, allowing it to forego hunting and foraging like other animals. However, its journey is still very dangerous. // 苹果猫是蛞蝓猫的特殊变种，热爱和平。它具有进行光合作用的能力，使其能够像其他动物一样放弃狩猎和觅食。然而，它的旅程仍然非常危险。 // Applecat can undergo photosynthesis and automatically regain saturation as long as there are no objects on its head and the player's location is bright. The color of its body gradually changes as its saturation increases. // 只要Applecat头上没有物体并且玩家所在位置明亮，Applecat就可以进行光合作用并自动恢复饱和度。随着饱和度的增加，它身体的颜色也逐渐发生变化。 // Applecat can now spit out objects called candies, which consume saturation. Additionally, if the player is holding an item, they can perform a dance by holding the up arrow key and the pick-up key. // Applecat 现在可以吐出称为糖果的物体，该物体会消耗饱和度。此外，如果玩家持有物品，他们可以通过按住向上箭头键和拾取键来表演舞蹈。"
