> AtomVM, the Erlang virtual machine for IoT devices!
> 

ref: [AtomVM][site]

> Brings [Erlang][site-erlang], [Elixir][site-elixir] and other functional languages to really small systems.
> 
> AtomVM implements from scratch a minimal Erlang VM that supports a subset of ErlangVM features and that is able to run unmodified BEAM binaries on really small systems like MCUs.

[site-elixir]: https://elixir-lang.org

> #### Supported Platforms
> 
> - Linux, macOS, FreeBSD ([generic unix](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/blob/master/src/platforms/generic_unix))
> - ESP32 SoC (with IDF/FreeRTOS, see [README.ESP32.Md](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/blob/master/README.ESP32.Md))
> - STM32 MCUs (with LibOpenCM3, see [README.STM32.Md](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/blob/master/README.STM32.Md))
> 
> AtomVM aims to be easily portable to new platforms with a minimum effort, so additional platforms might be supported in a near future.
