He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few kinda clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus.git), and he was able to figure out the rest. // 此应用使用 WebRTC 在 docker 容器内流式传输桌面，原始作者创建这个应用是因为 rabb.it 倒闭了，他的互联网无法处理流媒体，而且当他的朋友尝试时，discord 不断崩溃。他只是想和朋友们一起看动漫(ಠ益ಠಲ)，所以他开始在互联网上挖掘，找到了一些类似克隆版，但没有一个有虚拟浏览器，然后他发现了 Turtus，并能够弄懂剩下的部分。 /// Then I found [this](https://github.com/nurdism/neko.git) project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with multiple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore, and it got eventually archived. // 然后我发现了这个项目并开始深入研究。我很喜欢多人协作浏览器的想法，所以我创建了一个分支。最初，我想将我的更改合并到上游仓库中，但原始作者已经没有时间维护这个项目了，最终它被归档了。"
