The enhanced output consists in an object of type 'chronicle' containing the result of the function applied to its arguments, as well as a log detailing when the function was run, what were its inputs, what were the errors (if the function failed to run) and other useful information. Tools to handle decorated functions are included, such as a forward pipe operator that makes chaining decorated functions possible. // 慢性子: 为函数添加日志 /// 装饰函数，使其返回增强输出。增强输出包括一个 \"chronicle\" 类型的对象，其中包含函数应用于其参数的结果，以及详细记录函数运行时间、输入内容、错误（如果函数运行失败）和其他有用信息的日志。此外，还提供了处理装饰函数的工具，例如前向管道运算符，可实现装饰函数的链式连接。"
