[site]: https://generics.r-lib.org/ "generics is designed to help package authors reduce dependencies by providing a set of generic methods that can be imported. For example, if a package author wanted to include a tidy method for their object, they would have to import the broom package to do so. This would work but would potentially increase the number of package dependencies required to install and/or test the package. // generics 旨在通过提供一组可导入的通用方法来帮助包作者减少依赖。例如，如果包作者想要为其对象包含一个 tidy 方法，他们必须导入 broom 包才能实现。这样虽然可行，但可能会增加安装和/或测试包所需的包依赖数量。"
