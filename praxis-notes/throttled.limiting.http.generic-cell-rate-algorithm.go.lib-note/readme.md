It is used to measure the timing of cells on virtual channels (VCs) and or Virtual Paths (VPs) against bandwidth and jitter limits contained in a traffic contract for the VC or VP to which the cells belong. Cells that do not conform to the limits given by the traffic contract may then be re-timed (delayed) in traffic shaping, or may be dropped (discarded) or reduced in priority (demoted) in traffic policing. Nonconforming cells that are reduced in priority may then be dropped, in preference to higher priority cells, by downstream components in the network that are experiencing congestion. Alternatively they may reach their destination (VC or VP termination) if there is enough capacity for them, despite them being excess cells as far as the contract is concerned: see priority control. // 通用信元速率算法（GCRA）是一种用于异步传输模式（ATM）网络中网络调度器的漏桶类型调度算法。它用于测量属于某个虚拟信道（VC）或虚拟路径（VP）的信元的时序，并与该 VC 或 VP 的流量合同中包含的带宽和抖动限制进行比较。不符合流量合同规定的限制的信元，在流量整形中可能会被重新定时（延迟），或在流量监管中被丢弃（抛弃）或降低优先级（降级）。优先级被降低的不符合规定的信元可能会被网络中遇到拥塞的下游组件优先丢弃，而不是优先级更高的信元。或者，如果网络有足够的容量，即使这些信元从合同的角度来看是多余的，它们也可能到达目的地（VC 或 VP 终止）：参见优先级控制。') to limit access to resources such as HTTP endpoints. // Package throttled 使用通用细胞速率算法实现速率限制，以限制对 HTTP 端点等资源的访问。 /// The 2.0.0 release made some major changes to the throttled API. If this change broke your code in problematic ways or you wish a feature of the old API had been retained, please open an issue. We don't guarantee any particular changes but would like to hear more about what our users need. Thanks! // 2.0.0 版本对 throttled API 进行了一些重大更改。如果这些更改以问题的方式破坏了您的代码，或者您希望保留旧 API 的某个功能，请打开一个问题。我们不保证任何特定的更改，但希望听到更多关于我们的用户需要什么的信息。谢谢！"
