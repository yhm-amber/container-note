However, there are few national assessments of diabetes care during hospitalization which could serve as a baseline for change. This analysis of a large clinical database (74 million unique encounters corresponding to 17 million unique patients) was undertaken to provide such an assessment and to find future directions which might lead to improvements in patient safety. Almost 70,000 inpatient diabetes encounters were identified with sufficient detail for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to fit the relationship between the measurement of HbA1c and early readmission while controlling for covariates such as demographics, severity and type of the disease, and type of admission. Results show that the measurement of HbA1c was performed infrequently (18.4%) in the inpatient setting. The statistical model suggests that the relationship between the probability of readmission and the HbA1c measurement depends on the primary diagnosis. The data suggest further that the greater attention to diabetes reflected in HbA1c determination may improve patient outcomes and lower cost of inpatient care. // 住院患者高血糖的管理对病情的严重程度和死亡率都有重要影响。然而，目前很少有全国性的住院期间糖尿病护理评估可以作为改进的基准。这项分析基于一个大型临床数据库（7400 万次独特就诊记录，对应 1700 万独特患者）进行，旨在提供此类评估并寻找可能改善患者安全的未来方向。研究识别了近 7 万例具有足够分析细节的住院糖尿病就诊记录。采用多变量逻辑回归模型，在控制人口统计学、疾病严重程度和类型、以及入院类型等协变量后，分析了 HbA1c 检测与早期再入院之间的关系。结果显示，在住院环境中 HbA1c 检测的频率较低（18.4%）。统计模型表明，再入院概率与 HbA1c 检测之间的关系取决于主要诊断。 数据显示，更关注糖尿病（如通过 HbA1c 检测）可能改善患者预后并降低住院治疗成本。 /// It is increasingly recognized that the management of hyperglycemia in the hospitalized patient has a significant bearing on outcome, in terms of both morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. This recognition has led to the development of formalized protocols in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting with rigorous glucose targets in many institutions [3]. However, the same cannot be said for most non-ICU inpatient admissions. Rather, anecdotal evidence suggests that inpatient management is arbitrary and often leads to either no treatment at all or wide fluctuations in glucose when traditional management strategies are employed. Although data are few, recent controlled trials have demonstrated that protocol-driven inpatient strategies can be both effective and safe [4, 5]. As such, implementation of protocols in the hospital setting is now recommended [6, 7]. However, there are few national assessments of diabetes care in the hospitalized patient which could serve as a baseline for change. The present analysis of a large clinical database was undertaken to examine historical patterns of diabetes care in patients with diabetes admitted to a US hospital and to inform future directions which might lead to improvements in patient safety. In particular, we examined the use of HbA1c as a marker of attention to diabetes care in a large number of individuals identified as having a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. We hypothesize that measurement of HbA1c is associated with a reduction in readmission rates in individuals admitted to the hospital. // 人们越来越认识到，住院患者的高血糖管理对病情和死亡率都有显著影响[1,2]。这种认识促使许多机构在重症监护室（ICU）环境中制定了正式的协议，并设定了严格的血糖目标[3]。然而，对于大多数非 ICU 住院患者来说，情况并非如此。相反，零星的证据表明，住院管理是随机的，在采用传统管理策略时，往往导致完全不治疗或血糖大幅波动。尽管数据有限，最近的对照试验已经证明，协议驱动的住院策略既有效又安全[4,5]。因此，现在建议在医院环境中实施协议[6,7]。然而，目前很少有关于住院患者糖尿病护理的全国性评估，可以作为变革的基准。 对大型临床数据库的当前分析旨在考察糖尿病患者入院至美国医院的糖尿病护理历史模式，并为进一步改善患者安全提供方向。特别地，我们考察了将 HbA1c 作为糖尿病护理关注指标的广泛个体使用情况，这些个体被诊断为患有糖尿病。我们假设 HbA1c 的测量与入院患者的再入院率降低相关。 /// Databases of clinical data contain valuable but heterogeneous and difficult data in terms of missing values, incomplete or inconsistent records, and high dimensionality understood not only by number of features but also their complexity. [8]. Additionally, analyzing external data is more challenging than analysis of results of a carefully designed experiment or trial, because one has no impact on how and what type of information was collected. Nonetheless, it is important to utilize these huge amounts of data to find new information/knowledge that is possibly not available anywhere. // 临床数据数据库包含有价值但异构且难以处理的数据，包括缺失值、不完整或不一致的记录以及高维度数据，这些不仅体现在特征数量上，还体现在其复杂性上。[8]。此外，分析外部数据比分析精心设计的实验或试验结果更具挑战性，因为无法影响信息和数据类型是如何收集的。尽管如此，利用这些大量数据以发现可能任何地方都不存在的新信息/知识非常重要。"
