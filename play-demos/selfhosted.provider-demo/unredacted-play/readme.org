Unredacted is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that builds Internet infrastructure and services to help people evade censorship and protect their right to *privacy*.

We believe that privacy is a right and that free, open access to *information* is deeply important.

Together, these principles allow humanity to *develop freely*.

*** Censorship Evasion (CE)

*** Secure Infrastructure (SI)

- [[https://xmpp.is/][XMPP/Jabber server]]: We’ve been operating since May 2015, that’s over 8 years of continuous operation! Wow, we’re sure feeling pretty old now… While there hasn’t been many new features on XMPP.is, it sort of just runs itself for the most part (of course we patch for security updates regularly).
- [[https://matrix.unredacted.org][Unredacted Matrix Server]]: Unredacted hosts a public and security focused Matrix server for you to chat securely and privately on the decentralized Matrix ecosystem. Matrix offers a lot, including a vast network of homeservers consisting of many communities and is often end-to-end encrypted by default.
