> Matrix is an open specification for an online communication protocol.
>  It includes all the features you'd expect from a modern chat platform
>  including instant messaging, group chats, audio and video calls,
>  searchable message history, synchronization across all your devices,
>  and end-to-end encryption.
>  Matrix is federated, so no single company controls the system or your data.
>  You can use an existing server you trust or run your own, and the servers synchronize messages seamlessly.
